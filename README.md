## Description
The DD43.1 is built off of the G43 SS80 Frame by FreeMenDontAsk. It utilizes the same design concepts from the newer DD17.2 models, which incorperates a milled front locking block, and stamped (or milled) rear rails. This enable the frame to be created by DIY methods rather than be reliant on proprietary products.

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each [x] you make.
- x1 **Glock 43 Parts Kit** - Procure a parts kit of your preference. You must use only Glock 43 compatible parts- 43X and 42 parts are NOT supported.
- x1 **Steel Spring** - this is for retaining the magazine release button
- x1 **Front Rail Block** - This is to secure the front of the slide.
- x1 **Rear Rail Stamp** - Ideally, this should be a stamped part, but can be made by milling.
- x1 **Glock 43 Magazine** - ETS mags work best. An OEM Glock 43 mag may be slightly snug.

## Instructions
Print the frame standing up. Preferred filament should be eSun PLA+. Print at 50 mm/s @ 230C. Use tree supports for easy clean up.

See included PDF for assembly instructions.

## Change Log

- v0.4: Private Beta Version 4
    * Adjusted frame to accomodate magazine seating and feeding compatibilty.

- v0.3: Private Beta Version 3
    * Adjusted frame to prevent tilting aftermarket rear trigger group
    * Added two variants to rear rails for testing- one lowered by 0.5mm and another by 1.0mm. Testing to see which of them address trigger bar binding (subtlely).

- v0.2: Private Beta Version 2
    * Adjusted rear hole placement to raise up by 0.5mm, which will raise the sear cage by 0.5mm. This should address the trigger not resetting when slide is pulled rear-and-upwards
