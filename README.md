## Description
The DD43.1 is built off of the G43 SS80 Frame by FreeMenDontAsk. It utilizes the same design concepts from the newer DD17.2 models, which incorperates a milled front locking block, and stamped (or milled) rear rails. This enable the frame to be created by DIY methods rather than be relied on 

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each [x] you make.
- x1 **Glock 43Parts Kit** - Procure a parts kit of your preference. You must use only Glock 43 compatible parts- 43X and 42 parts are NOT supported.
- x1 **Steel Spring** - this is for retaining the magazine release button
- x1 **Front Rail Block** - This is to secure the front of the slide.
- x1 **Rear Rail Stamp** - Ideally, this should be a stamped part, but can be made by milling.
- x1 **Glock 43 Magazine** - ETS mags work best. An OEM Glock 43 mag may be slightly snug.

## Instructions
1. Print the frame standing up. Preferred filament should be eSun PLA+. Print at 50 mm/s @ 230C. Use tree supports for easy clean up.
2. Remove ALL SUPPORTS and support artifacts entirely from the frame, especially the pockets where the parts are to be inserted.
3. Gently file and sand the magwell to fit your magazine to your preference. (Say, drop-free or not.)
4. Fit-Assemble the magazine release, and magazine release spring.
5. Insert the front locking block and pin it in place.
6. Assemble the trigger and fire-control group into one piece. Insert the rear rail into the pocket, followed by the entire fire control assembly into the frame.
7. Insert the slide lock. Be sure it fits into the slot.
8. Insert the locking block.
9. Pin the locking block, trigger, and slide release into place.
10. Pin the rear fire-control group into place.
11. Assemble the locking tab and locking tab spring into the frame.
12. Assemble the slide onto the frame and perform a function check.

## Change Log

- v0.2: Private Beta Version 2
    * Adjusted rear hole placement to raise up by 0.5mm, which will raise the sear cage by 0.5mm. This should address the trigger not resetting when slide is pulled rear-and-upwards

- v0.1: Private Beta Version 1
    * Initial commit into advanced evaluation
